# AccelRotaryEncoder
Here an update version of RotaryEncoderAcceleration by Ben Buxton who has developed it for Arduino 1.0. I made some upgrades and changes to fit my project and make this library works like a charm with MENWIZ.

An example for MENWIZ is also provided to help all the people who are looking for a solution for Rotary Encoder/LCD/MENWIZ working in 3 buttons mode.
